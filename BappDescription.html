<p>Interesting Files Scanner extends Burp Suite's active scanner, with scans for interesting files and directories.
A main feature of the extension is the check for false positives with tested patterns for each case. Furthermore,
a Burp Suite tab is present to select/unselect the checks to perform, to avoid network overload.

For example the following file checks are implemented:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Interesting Files such as .git/config</li>
	<li>SSH private keys</li>
	<li>Various .key files</li>
	<li>Common PHP files and the corresponding backup files</li>
	<li>SQL database files</li>
</ul>

<p>This extension requires Burp Suite Professional and Jython 2.5 or later standalone</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact, if you miss any interesting file checks or discover any bugs.
Only file checks with sufficient patterns, to avoid false positives, can be implemented.</p>
